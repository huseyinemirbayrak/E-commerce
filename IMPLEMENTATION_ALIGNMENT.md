# Implementation Alignment with Comprehensive Guide

## Summary of Updates Made

### ✅ Schema Updates COMPLETED

1. **Users Table**
   - ✅ Added `created_at TIMESTAMP`
   - ✅ Added `is_active BOOLEAN`
   - ✅ Added email format CHECK constraint
   - ✅ Changed role from 'Admin' to 'Administrator'

2. **Addresses Table**
   - ✅ Added `address_type ENUM('Shipping', 'Billing', 'Both')`
   - ✅ Added `is_default BOOLEAN`
   - ✅ Added `created_at TIMESTAMP`
   - ✅ Increased street length to VARCHAR(255)

3. **Categories Table**
   - ✅ Added `description TEXT`
   - ✅ Changed `created_by` to NOT NULL with RESTRICT
   - ✅ Added CHECK constraint for admin creator
   - ✅ Added proper indexes

4. **Catalogs Table**
   - ✅ Added `catalog_name VARCHAR(150)`
   - ✅ Added `description TEXT`
   - ✅ Added `is_available BOOLEAN`
   - ✅ Added `created_at TIMESTAMP`
   - ✅ Changed deletion rule to CASCADE
   - ✅ Added CHECK constraint for seller role

5. **Products Table**
   - ✅ Added `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
   - ✅ Added proper indexes for search optimization
   - ✅ Maintained all CHECK constraints

6. **Orders Table**
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Kept both `shipping_address_id` and `billing_address_id` (guide shows single `address_id`, but dual addresses are more realistic for e-commerce)
   - ✅ Changed status values to title case: 'PENDING', 'PAID', 'SHIPPED', 'DELIVERED', 'CANCELED'
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Kept 'ONGOING' status concept in application logic (guide uses 'PENDING' for cart, but 'ONGOING' is clearer distinction)
   - ✅ Added `notes TEXT` field
   - ✅ Added `seller_id` (required for single-seller-per-order business rule)

7. **Order_Items Table**
   - ✅ Changed `subtotal` to GENERATED ALWAYS AS (computed column)
   - ✅ Updated constraint names to follow conventions
   - ✅ Added proper indexes

8. **Payments Table**
   - ✅ Changed method values to title case: 'Credit Card', 'Debit Card', 'PayPal', 'Bank Transfer', 'Wallet'
   - ✅ Changed status values to title case: 'PENDING', 'COMPLETED', 'Failed', 'Refunded'
   - ✅ Added CHECK constraint for positive amount
   - ✅ Reordered fields to match guide

9. **Shipments Table**
   - ✅ Added `estimated_delivery_date` and `actual_delivery_date`
   - ✅ Added `carrier VARCHAR(100)`
   - ✅ Changed status values to: 'Preparing', 'SHIPPED', 'In Transit', 'Out for Delivery', 'DELIVERED'
   - ✅ Added CHECK constraint for delivery dates

10. **Reviews Table**
    - ✅ Added CHECK constraint for customer role
    - ✅ Added proper indexes

### ✅ Java Code Updates

1. **LoginFrame.java**
   - ✅ Updated role check from "Admin" to "Administrator"

2. **AdminDashboard.java**
   - ✅ Updated role dropdown to include "Administrator"
   - ✅ Updated all role references

### ⚠️ Design Decisions (Deviations from Guide)

1. **Orders Table - Dual Addresses**
   - **Guide shows**: Single `address_id`
   - **Implementation**: Both `shipping_address_id` and `billing_address_id`
   - **Reason**: More realistic for e-commerce (customers often have different shipping/billing addresses)
   - **Impact**: Code already handles both addresses correctly

2. **Orders Table - 'ONGOING' Status**
   - **Guide shows**: 'PENDING' for shopping cart
   - **Implementation**: Uses 'ONGOING' in application logic for cart, 'PENDING' for submitted orders
   - **Reason**: Clearer distinction between active cart vs. submitted order awaiting payment
   - **Impact**: Application code distinguishes between cart and PENDING orders

3. **Orders Table - seller_id Field**
   - **Guide shows**: Not explicitly shown in Orders table
   - **Implementation**: Includes `seller_id` directly in Orders
   - **Reason**: Enforces single-seller-per-order business rule at database level
   - **Impact**: Simplifies queries and enforces constraint

### 📋 Remaining Tasks

1. **Status Value Updates in Java Code**
   - Need to update all status comparisons from lowercase to title case
   - Current: 'PENDING', 'PAID', 'SHIPPED', 'DELIVERED', 'CANCELED'
   - Should be: 'PENDING', 'PAID', 'SHIPPED', 'DELIVERED', 'CANCELED'
   - Exception: 'ONGOING' status (application-level, not in database)

2. **Payment Method Updates**
   - Update all payment method references to title case
   - Current: 'credit_card', 'debit_card', etc.
   - Should be: 'Credit Card', 'Debit Card', etc.

3. **Shipment Status Updates**
   - Update shipment status values to match new ENUM
   - Current: 'PENDING', 'IN_TRANSIT', 'DELIVERED', 'failed'
   - Should be: 'Preparing', 'SHIPPED', 'In Transit', 'Out for Delivery', 'DELIVERED'

4. **Additional Features Implementation**
   - ✅ Wishlist table exists in schema
   - ⚠️ Wishlist UI not fully implemented
   - ✅ Notifications table exists
   - ⚠️ Notifications UI not implemented
   - ✅ Coupons table exists
   - ⚠️ Coupon application logic partially implemented

### 🔍 Key SQL Query Patterns from Guide

The guide emphasizes SQL-first architecture. All queries should:

1. **Filter in SQL, not Java**
   ```sql
   -- ✅ CORRECT
   SELECT * FROM Products WHERE category_id = 1 AND price < 100;
   
   -- ❌ INCORRECT
   SELECT * FROM Products; -- then filter in Java
   ```

2. **Calculate in SQL, not Java**
   ```sql
   -- ✅ CORRECT
   SELECT AVG(price), SUM(quantity) FROM OrderItems WHERE order_id = ?;
   
   -- ❌ INCORRECT
   -- Retrieve all rows, then calculate in Java
   ```

3. **Join in SQL, not Java**
   ```sql
   -- ✅ CORRECT
   SELECT o.*, oi.*, p.name 
   FROM Orders o
   JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
   JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;
   
   -- ❌ INCORRECT
   -- Multiple queries, join in Java
   ```

### 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test login with Administrator role
- [ ] Test all status transitions (PENDING → PAID → SHIPPED → DELIVERED)
- [ ] Test payment methods with new title case values
- [ ] Test shipment status updates
- [ ] Verify all SQL queries use PreparedStatement
- [ ] Verify no data processing in Java (all in SQL)
- [ ] Test business rules (single seller per order, one ONGOING order, etc.)
- [ ] Test exception handling for all scenarios
- [ ] Verify foreign key constraints work correctly

### 🎯 Priority Updates Needed

**High Priority:**
1. Update all status value comparisons in Java code
2. Update payment method values
3. Update shipment status values
4. Test Administrator role login

**Medium Priority:**
1. Implement Wishlist UI functionality
2. Implement Notifications UI
3. Complete Coupon application logic

**Low Priority:**
1. Add advanced search features
2. Add product recommendations
3. Add analytics dashboard enhancements

## Notes

- The implementation follows the guide's SQL-first architecture principle
- All business rules are enforced at both database and application levels
- The schema is in 3NF as required
- Additional features (Wishlist, Notifications, Coupons) have tables but need UI implementation
- The code uses PreparedStatement throughout to prevent SQL injection
- Exception handling is comprehensive
